docviewer
=========

Docviewer is a proxy script for launching the "best" available PDF viewer
among those available on the local system.  It searches for common PDF viewers
such as qpdfview, okular, evince, etc. and runs the first one it finds.

By configuring applications such as Firefox or Thunderbird to use docviewer,
you can avoid reconfiguring if you switch to a different PDF viewer or an
entirely different desktop environment.
